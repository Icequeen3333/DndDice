# DndRolling
Dnd character project ive been working on for a few months. unfinished as of 8/7 but really close to done

# Dnd roll
this class has all the features of how to roll the dice, with damage, stat checks, flat rolls and advantage and disadvantage.

# Dnd char
this class essentially has the setup to dndroll, with a method that asks for all the information required to roll

# Dnd Stats
this class is a mess. It's to check the modifiers and to make sure that the stat associated has the correct modifier to any rolls.
